                            Lifewood is more than just a company that processes data, delivers at speed, and
                            produces projects in multiple languages for some of the world's largest organizations.
                            While these capabilities are essential, they do not fully capture the essence of who we are.
                            At our core, we must define and communicate our identityâ€”both internally to our global teams
                            and externally to our clients, investors, stakeholders, and friends spread across the world.

                            The communications team began this journey by revisiting the Lifewood Strategic Positioning
                            document presented in Malaysia in November 2023. This document outlines important themes and
                            ideas that encapsulate Lifewood's approach to business, highlighting the role we play in Malaysia,
                            Singapore, mainland China, and across South-East Asia and the world. It emphasizes Lifewood as
                            a bridge between ASEAN and China, and by extension, the rest of the world.

                            With our headquarters in Malaysia, Lifewood is ideally situated to support the country's
                            role as a super-bridge connecting China with other nations, especially during these times
                            of tension between East and West. Our vast data resources have the potential to analyze
                            social and environmental challenges not only in Malaysia but also in Singapore and beyond,
                            contributing to social progress and development.

                            Moreover, Lifewood places a strong emphasis on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)
                            principles, which are evident in our HR policies. In countries like Bangladesh, our Pottya team
                            has taken significant steps to employ a high percentage of women and people with disabilities,
                            particularly in an environment where these groups are often underrepresented.

                            communications strategy that not only highlights our capabilities but also showcases our
                            commitment to fostering positive change across the regions we serve.
